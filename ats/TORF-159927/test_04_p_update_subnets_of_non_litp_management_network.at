#       TORF-159928 As a litp user i want to be able to modify subnet definition
#       in the model and have the networking plugin act accordingly
#
#       TEST_04_P_UPDATE_SUBNETS_OF_NON_LITP_MANAGEMENT_NETWORK
#       Description:
#               Test to verify that a user can update the subnets of a network
#               not defined as the litp_management network .i.e. traffic networks
#
#       Steps:
#               1. Create networks on a vcs-cluster
#               2. Create/ Run plan
#               3. Update network subnets of non litp-management network
#               4. Create Plan
#               5. Ensure no validation error is returned
#       Expected Result:
#               A user can update the subnet of a network that is not configured as
#               the litp_management network.
#
# Step 1: Create networks on a vcs-cluster
runLitpScript basic_scenario.atlib

# Step 2: Create/ Run plan
assertPlanState successful

# Step 3: Update network subnets of non litp-management network, in this case a traffic network
litp update -p /infrastructure/networking/networks/t3 -o subnet=10.10.40.0/23

# Step 4: Create/ Run plan again
litp create_plan
